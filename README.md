# Polarity Logic Controller
An introductory digital logic project implemented in VHDL targeting an Altera MAX 10 FPGA using Intel Quartus Prime. It includes a polarity controller module for conditional inversion of signals and a logic gate module implementing AND, NAND, OR, and XOR operations. Designed with a modular architecture for integration into larger digital systems.
